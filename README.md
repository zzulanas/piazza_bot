PiazzaBot will give you a embeded preview of a Piazza post right on your server!
Just enter in the link to the post, and PiazzaBot will take care of the rest! 

## Installation
To run PiazzaBot locally, do the following: 

1. First make a virtual environment in python using

```
python3 -m venv ./env
source ./env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements
```

2. Export your environment variables as such
```
export EMAIL='{your email here}'
export PASSWORD='{your password here}`
export DISCORD_TOKEN='{your Discord Bot Token}'
export GUILD_ID='{your server ID}'

3. Then run the program with `python3 ./connect.py`

it won't work.
